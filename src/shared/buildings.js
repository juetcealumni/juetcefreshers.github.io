    body:"The seeds of the Department were sown in the Electrical Engineering Department of Jadavpur University, when Professor Jnan Saran Chatterjee, the founder of the ETCE Department, JU was recruited by the then Vice-Chancellor, Prof. Dr. Triguna Sen. Prof. J. S. Chatterjee joined the Electrical Engineering (EE) Department (Communication Specialization) during 1955. At that time, Prof. H. C. Guha introduced the ‘Communication Specialization’ at the EE Dept., JU in 1951, out of which the Tele-Communication area sprang off. Prof. Sen’s idea was that Prof. J. S. Chatterjee would plan to set up a separate Department of Tele-Communication Engineering. Prof. J. S. Chatterjee came from Institute of Radio Physics and Electronics, Calcutta University. A year later during 1956, his student, Prof. A. R. Saha joined the Electrical Engineering Department (Communication Engineering Specialization). Prof. J. S. Chatterjee and Prof. A. R. Saha worked together in the planning and setting up of this Department. Finally, a new Department, called ‘Tele-Communication Engineering ’ was born under the leadership of Prof. J. S. Chatterjee during 1957, and it was housed in a separate building within the Campus. During the next few years, Prof. P. Kundu, S. Deb, S. Banerjee, U. S. Ganguly, B. Nag and P. C. Sen joined this new Department. ",
